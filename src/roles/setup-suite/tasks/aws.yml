#
# 1. Configure ~/.ssh/config:  (add to file and replace the key for example with aws_ppl.pem)
#    ```
#    Host ec2*
#    IdentifyFile ~/.ssh/{{ exp_base.key_name }}
#    ForwardAgent yes

# 2. Add the GitHub private key to ssh-agent:
#
#   ssh-aadd ~/.ssh/private_key_rsa
#
# 3. (On a MAC, need add to keychain)
