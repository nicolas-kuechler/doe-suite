# This role considers the cmd arguments and resolves the suite id (either by creating a new one or finding the most recent for this suite).
# Afterward, for a new suite (i.e., id=='new'), the role reads and validates the suite design file. At the same time, default values are inserted for missing optional parameters.
# The validated suite design including the set default values is written into the suite folder.
# Finally, the `my_suite_design`, `host_types` and `common_roles` variables are set on localhost. The `host_types` variable shows what kind of hosts (e.g., ec2 instances) are required.
