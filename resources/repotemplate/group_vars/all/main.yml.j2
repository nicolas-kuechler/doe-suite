# TODO: The following parameters define how the playbook checks whether a job finished, fetches the results and starts the next job.
# - 'job_n_tries' is the maximal number times we check the job's status before aborting
# - 'job_check_wait_time' is the time (in seconds) to wait in between checking whether a job finished
# Note that those parameters directly influence the playbook duration:
# Each experiments runs for at most #jobs * 'job_n_tries' * 'job_check_wait_time' seconds (usually less when the experiment finishes earlier).
# The experiments are mostly run concurrently (apart from the setup and cleanup parts). Thus, the experiment with the most jobs defines the
# maximal duration. But as experiments usually use fewer than 'job_n_tries' tries, an experiment with few long-running jobs can be the bottleneck too.
job_n_tries: <<job_n_tries>>   # should be max 1000 (otherwise playbook freezes -> unsure why)
