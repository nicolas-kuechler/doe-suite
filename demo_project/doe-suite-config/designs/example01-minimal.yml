# The suite `example01-minimal` contains a single experiment called `minimal`.
# We run this experiment on a single instance `n=1` of host type `small` and we only use a single repetition.
# The experiment consists of four runs, i.e., configurations:
# - echo "hello world."
# - echo "hello world!"
# - echo "hello universe."
# - echo "hello universe!"
#
# For the experiment configuration, we use the `cross` format:
# The different levels for each factor are listed in `base_experiment` and
# we create the runs by taking a cross product of all factor levels.
# (e.g., [world, universe] x [".", "!"] results in 4 runs)
