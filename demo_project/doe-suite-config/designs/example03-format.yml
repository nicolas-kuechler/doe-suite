# Example Goal - Demonstrate the use of the two (three) formats for expressing factors (varying parameters).
#
# The  2(+1) different formats:
# - the `cross` format is the concise form for a cross product of all factors
# - the `level-list` format allows to specify a list with a concrete level for each factor (i.e., not full cross-product)
# - a mix between `cross` and `level-list` format that combines the advantages of both formats.
#
# The `cross` format uses the keyword `$FACTOR$` as a YAML key,
# while the `factor list` uses `$FACTOR$` as a YAML value and expects a corresponding level in the `factor_levels` list.
#
# The `except_filters` construct can be used to ignore specific combinations of configuration (e.g., the cross product between two factors except a specific combination should be skipped)

# experiment in the pure `cross` format
format_cross:
  n_repetitions: 1 # no repetition

    small:
      n: 1
      $CMD$: "echo \"run app=[% my_run.app.name %] with vec=[% my_run.vector_size %] seed=[% my_run.seed %]\"" # use echo as example
  base_experiment:
    seed: 1234 # constant
    vector_size:
      $FACTOR$: [10, 20, 30, 40] # varied parameter between runs (factor)
    app:
      name:
        $FACTOR$: [app1, app2, app3]  # varied parameter between runs (factor)
      # hyperparam: X  -> not used in this experiment
  except_filters:
  # we ignore the combination of vector_size 40 with app2 and app3 and only run it with app1
  - vector_size: 40

      name: app2

  #
  # The experiment `format_cross` results in 10 runs:
  # - {"vector_size": 10, "app.name": app1, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 10, "app.name": app2, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 10, "app.name": app3, "seed": 1234}

  # - {"vector_size": 20, "app.name": app1, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 20, "app.name": app2, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 20, "app.name": app3, "seed": 1234}

  # - {"vector_size": 30, "app.name": app1, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 30, "app.name": app2, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 30, "app.name": app3, "seed": 1234}

  # - {"vector_size": 40, "app.name": app1, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"vector_size": 40, "app.name": app2, "seed": 1234} -> Ignored by except_filters
  # - {"vector_size": 40, "app.name": app3, "seed": 1234} -> Ignored by except_filters

  base_experiment:
    seed: 1234
    # vector_size: X .> not used in this experiment
    app:
      name: $FACTOR$        # varied parameter between runs (factor)
      hyperparam: $FACTOR$  # varied parameter between runs (factor)

        name: app1

        name: app2
        hyperparam: 10
    - app:
        name: app3
        hyperparam: 5
  # The `level-list`format has the advantage that we don't need to create a run for the full cross product of factors.
  #   (e.g., here each app has a specific hyperparam, hence we don't want to run the full cross product because the hyperparam is app specific)
  #
  # The experiment `format_levellist` results in 3 runs:
  # - {"app.name": app1, "app.hyperparam": 0.1, "seed": 1234}
  # - {"app.name": app2, "app.hyperparam": 10 , "seed": 1234}
  # - {"app.name": app3, "app.hyperparam": 5 , "seed": 1234}

  # The mix between `cross`and `level-list` is the most flexible because it allows to define $FACTORS$
  # for which we want to create the cross product (e.g., `vector_size`) and
  # other factors to create the level list (e.g., app.name, app.hyperparam).
  #
  # In this example, the `hyperparam` is app specific and hence it does not make sense to create a
  # cross product between app name and hyperparam. In the `cross`format this is not possible,
  # while in the `level-list` format we would have to list all 12 runs under `factor_levels`.
  #
  # The experiment `format_mixed` results in 12 runs:
